After parsing the next stage of the compiler applies a defunctionalising
transformation to the input programs. Our defunctionalisation method is limited
in scope, but sufficient for our purposes. It specialises higher-order
functions defining separate instances for different functional arguments. We
are careful to preserve sharing during this transformation. Here we give our
motivation for introducing this transformation.

Central to our design is the concept of \verb-par- placement within a program.
Each \verb-par- application can be identified by its \emph{position} in the
AST. In a higher-order program basing our parallelism on the location of a
\verb-par- would very likely lead to undesirable consequences. For example, a common pattern
in parallel programs is to introduce a parallel version of the \verb-map-
function

\begin{alltt}
    parMap :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]
    parMap f []     = []
    parMap f (x:xs) = let y = f x
                      in y `par` y : parMap f xs
\end{alltt}

There is inevitably some overhead associated with evaluation of a \verb-par-
application, and of sparking off a fresh parallel thread.  So if the
computation \verb-f x- is inexpensive, the parallelism may not provide any
benefit and could even be detrimental. As \verb-parMap- may be used throughout
a program it is possible that there are both useful and detrimental parallel
applications for various functional arguments: \verb-parMap f- may provide
useful parallelism while \verb-parMap g- may cost more in overhead than we gain
from any parallelism.  Unfortunately when this occurs we are unable to switch
off the \verb-par- for \verb-parMap g- without losing the useful parallelism of
\verb-parMap f-. This is because the \verb-par- annotation is within the body
of \verb-parMap-. By specialising \verb-parMap- we create two separate
functions: \verb-parMap_f- and \verb-parMap_g-, with distinct \verb-par-
annotations in \emph{each} of the instances of \verb-parMap-.

\pagebreak

\begin{alltt}
    parMap_f []     = []
    parMap_f (x:xs) = let y = f x
                      in y `par` y : parMap_f xs

    parMap_g []     = []
    parMap_g (x:xs) = let y = g x
                      in y `par` y : parMap_g xs
\end{alltt}


After defunctionalisation we can determine the usefulness of parallelism
in each case independently. The plan is to deactivate the \verb-par- for the
inexpensive computation, \verb-g x-, without affecting the parallel application
of the worthwhile computation, \verb-f x-.

\subsection{How We Defunctionalise}

Our defunctionaliser makes the following set of assumptions:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Algebraic data structures are first-order (no functional components)
  \item The patterns on the left-hand side of a declaration have been compiled
        into case expressions
  \item Functions may have functional arguments but their definitions must be
        arity-saturated and return data-value results
  \item No explicit lambdas in the program, but partial applications are permitted
\end{itemize}

With these assumptions in mind, the rules for defunctionalisation are presented
in Figure \ref{defunRules}. These rules are applied to the AST in a
\emph{bottom up} fashion. This allows the transformation to assume that the
arguments to partially applied functions (like $e'_{1}$ in (1)) have already
been defunctionalised.

\paragraph{Example}

Take \verb-reverse- defined as an instance of \verb-foldl-:

\begin{verbatim}
    reverse xs  =  foldl (flip Cons) Nil xs
\end{verbatim}

this becomes

\begin{verbatim}
    reverse xs  =  foldl_flip_Cons Nil xs

    foldl_flip_Cons z xs 
        = case xs of
            Nil       -> z
            Cons y ys ->
                foldl_flip_Cons (flip_Cons z y) ys

    flip_Cons xs x = Cons x xs
\end{verbatim}

Another important benefit of applying defunctionalisation to the program is
that it allows the use of Hinze's projection-based strictness analysis
\citep{hinze1995projection}, which we discuss next.
