One of the main motivators of this work was the lack of attention implicit
parallelism has been receiving in the functional programming community. Historically
functional programmers were optimistic about the feasibility and benefit of systems
designed to exploit the inherent parallelism in our programs. One of our aims with
this work was to show that despite difficulties in the past there are still areas,
techniques, and analyses worth exploring in this research area.

We therefore turn our attention to the future and discuss some of the possible
avenues of exploration.
