This chapter provides a summary and review of our contributions, allowing us to
determine what was accomplished and what still requires work.

Because of the nature of our work, and of compilers in general, decisions
about earlier phases of the compiler have consequences for the later
stages, often forcing the hand of the latter phases of the compiler.
For this reason we will review our work backwards, discussing the choices
and trade-offs made in the reverse order of the compiler pipeline. This will
allow us to consider alternative design choices and then consider what
requirements are placed on the earlier stages of the compiler.
