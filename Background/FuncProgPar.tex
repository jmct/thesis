Research into parallelism in lazy purely functional languages has a long
history that dates back to the early work on lazy functional languages
\citep{hughes:thesis, vGMachine, dutchBook, SPJ:PIFPL}\footnote{For a
comprehensive review we suggest \citep{hammond2000research}}. 


We are able to illustrate the issue with a simple example.  The two reductions
of $sqr$ in Figure \ref{fig:eagerandlazy} illustrate the key differences
between lazy evaluation and eager, or strict, evaluation.

     &sqr\ (5*5) \\

  =\ &625
\end{align*}
\end{multicols}

\label{fig:eagerandlazy}
\end{figure}

In the case of eager evaluation the argument to $sqr$ is evaluated
\emph{before} entering the function body. For lazy evaluation the argument is
passed as a suspended computation that is only \emph{forced} when the value is
needed (in this case when $x$ is needed in order to multiply $x*x$). Notice
that under lazy evaluation $5*5$ is only evaluated once, even though it is
used twice in the function. This is due to the \emph{sharing} of the result.
This is why laziness is often described as call-by-need \emph{with sharing}
\citep{hammond2000research}.

\medskip

In the case of $sqr$ in Figure \ref{fig:eagerandlazy}, both eager and lazy
evaluation required the same number of \emph{reductions} to compute the final
result. This is not always the case; take the following function definitions
\begin{align*}
    &bot \ :: \ Int\ \rightarrow\ Int \\
    &bot\ x\ =\ x + bot \\
    \quad & \\
    &const\ :: \ a\ \rightarrow\ b\ \rightarrow\ a \\
    &const\ x\ y\ =\ x
\end{align*}
\label{fig:botAndConst}

In an eager language the expression $const\ 5\ bot$ will never terminate,
while it would return $5$ in a lazy language as only the first argument
to $const$ is actually \emph{needed} in its body.
