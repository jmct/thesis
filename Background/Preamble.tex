This chapter explores previous approaches to parallelism in a
functional language, both implicit and explicit. We do this so that
we may better understand the trade-offs we accept when utilising
implicit parallelism and the difficulties involved.


General overview of why functional programming is considered `good' for
parallelism \citep{hughes:thesis}.
