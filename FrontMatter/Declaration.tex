Earlier versions of parts of this thesis were published in the
following papers:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Jos\'{e} Manuel Calder\'{o}n Trilla and Colin Runciman: Improving
            Implicit Parallelism in \emph{Haskell '15: Proceedings of the
            2015 ACM SIGPLAN Symposium on Haskell}, pg 153-164, ACM, 2015
    \item Jos\'{e} Manuel Calder\'{o}n Trilla, Simon Poulding, and Colin
            Runciman: Weaving Parallel Threads in \emph{SSBSE '15: Search-Based
            Software Engineering}, pg 62-76, Springer, 2015
\end{enumerate}

The first paper was conceived, implemented, and written by myself with
significant guidance and input from Prof. Runciman.

The second paper's central idea was my own. Prof. Runciman, Simon Poulding, and
myself developed the `plan of attack'. I then implemented the experimental
platform and ran the experiments. Simon Poulding performed the statistical
analysis of the results. The paper itself was written jointly by Simon Poulding
and myself.
