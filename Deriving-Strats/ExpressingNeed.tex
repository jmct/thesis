Burns introduced the idea of \emph{evaluation transformers} as a way to specify
the how much of a value can be reduced safely before it is needed
\citep{burn1987evaluation}. By using the results of a four-point strictness
analysis Burns was able to annotate expressions based on how much of the
structure could be safely evaluated. The main insight was that each annotation
represented a demand on the values and that demand could be propagated to the
sub-expressions in a well defined way.

Burns defined four `evaluators', each for lists, with the following meanings


\begin{itemize}
    \item ? performs no evaluation
    \item ? evaluates its argument to WHNF
    \item ? evaluates the spine of its argument
    \item ? evaluates the spine of its argument and each element to WHNF
\end{itemize}

These correspond directly to each point in Wadler's four-point domain.
