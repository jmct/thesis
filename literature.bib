  abstract = {
    The increasing availability of commodity multicore processors is making parallel computing
    ever more widespread. In order to exploit its potential, programmers need languages that
    make the benefits of parallelism accessible and understandable.
    Previous parallel languages have traditionally been intended for large-scale scientific
    computing, and they tend not to be well suited to programming the applications one typically
    finds on a desktop system.
    Thus, we need new parallel-language designs that address a broader spectrum of applications.
    The Manticore project is our effort to address this need. At its core is Parallel ML,
    a high-level functional language for programming parallel applications on commodity multicore
    hardware.
    Parallel ML provides a diverse collection of parallel constructs for different granularities
    of work. In this paper, we focus on the implicitly threaded parallel constructs of the
    language, which support fine-grained parallelism. We concentrate on those elements that
    distinguish our design from related ones, namely, a novel parallel binding form, a
    nondeterministic parallel case form, and the treatment of exceptions in the presence of data
    parallelism.
    These features differentiate the present work from related work on functional data-parallel
    language designs, which have focused largely on parallel problems with regular structure and
    the compiler transformations --- most notably, flatteningÑthat make such designs feasible.
    We present detailed examples utilizing various mechanisms of the language and give a formal
    description of our implementation.
