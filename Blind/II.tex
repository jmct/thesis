Now we have the machinery in place to \emph{improve} the initial placement
of parallel annotations by repeatedly running the program but altering
the bit string that represents the parallel annotations in the program.

%\paragraph{Compiler Pipeline} Figure \ref{fig:pipeline} shows the pipeline of
%our compiler \footnote{Lexing and parsing are omitted as they are done in
%the standard way and will not be discussed in this paper}. Each of the phases
%of the compiler is designed to facilitate the loop at the end of the pipeline.
%This feedback loop between the program runtime and the \verb-par- switching is
%the basis of our technique and the cornerstone of our contribution.
