We use the following Haskell representation of projections in our compiler.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\begin{BVerbatim}
data Context = CVar String
             | CRec String
             | CBot
             | CProd [Context]
             | CSum [(String, Context)]
             | CMu String Context
             | CStr Context
             | CLaz Context
\end{BVerbatim}
\end{figure}


Kubiak et al. were the first to show the utility of this representation and it
was then used in Hinze's work on projection-based analyses \cite{kubiak,
hinze1995projection}.
