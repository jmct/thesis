The rest of this chapter describes our technique in more detail. Section
\ref{sec:blind-ParFunc} discuss the main background to this work: implicit
parallelism in functional languages. Section~\ref{sec:blind-Overview} provides
a worked example to illustrate the static analysis we perform to determine
potential parallelism.  We describe our empirical method and results in Section
\ref{sec:blind-Results}. Lastly, we offer our conclusions and discuss related
work in Section \ref{sec:blind-Conclusion}.
