We have shown in this paper that the combination of static analysis and search can
parallelise programs. For some programs we are able to achieve close to linear
speed-ups which is as performant as can expected. As future work we will investigate
more sophisticated algorithms, including genetic algorithms and estimation of distribution
algorithms; and confirm the scalability of our approach.
