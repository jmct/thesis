We feel that this chapter has provided evidence that the combination of static
analysis and search can parallelise programs more effectively than through
static analysis alone. For some programs we are able to achieve close to linear
speed-ups which is as performant as can expected. These results are promising
for those looking to add iterative capabilities to their compiler but without
the ability to adapt the runtime system. By choosing an appropriate
representation of the available parallelism in a program we are able to use
standard search techniques to search the possible parallel configurations.

The success of the greedy algorithm was somewhat surprising. It further
supports the idea that the vast majority of potential parallelism in any given
program does not make up for the overhead costs associated with creating and
managing that parallelism.
